     * Proof Of Work is how blockchain mines (creates) a new block. When new transactions are created in the network,
     * miners (special nodes on the blockchain network) compete with each other to solve a problem. When any one miner solves the problem
     * first, it can generate the new block (adding transactions to it and adding to blockchain). The new blockchain is then propogated
     * through the entire network
     * The problem to be solved has the following characteristics:
     *  1. Easy to Verify
     *  2. Difficult to Find
     *  3. Computationally Expensive
     * The miner solving the problem is awarded (For eg: financially by getting issued a cryptocurrency)
     * Bitcoin uses a variation of POW algorithm called "HashCash". Read it up on wikipedia. The basic problem implemented in this code is as:
     * 
     * Find a number N that when hashed with the previous blockâ€™s POW number, a hash with 4 leading 0s is produced.
